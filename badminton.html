<h2>Badminton</h2>
<p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a 
shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger
 teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" 
(with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per 
side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity
 in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a 
rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the 
shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing 
side's half of the court.<br>

Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes 
over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor 
or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or 
(in their absence) the opposing side.<br>

The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) 
plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls
 used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers 
create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to 
decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top 
speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports.
 The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive
 nature.
