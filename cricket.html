<h2>Cricket</h2>
<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of
 eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard
 (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising 
two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs
 by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat 
(and running between the wickets), while the bowling and 
fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball 
from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) 
and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal
 include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and 
dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching 
the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the 
ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can
 cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have 
been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. 
The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire
 and match referee in international matches. They communicate 
with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical
 information</p>
