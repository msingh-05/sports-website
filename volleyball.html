<h2>Volleyball</h2>
<p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players
 are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by
 grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized 
rules. It has been a part of the official program of the 
Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.<br>

The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially
 proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 
'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then
 hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary 
line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's
 court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded
 within their court. The team may touch the ball up to three times,
 but individual players may not touch the ball twice 
consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to
 set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over
 the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to 
prevent it from being grounded in their court.
