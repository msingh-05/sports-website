<h2>Bascketball</h2>
<p>Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops,
 is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly
 of five players each, opposing one another on a 
rectangular court, compete with the primary objective
 of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) 
in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches 
(46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a 
backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the 
opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field
 goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the 
three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, 
timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to
 shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point
 free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the
 game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied,
 an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.<br>

Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or
 running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of
 which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use
 a variety of shotsâ€”the lay-up, the jump shot, or a dunk; on 
defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept 
passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect
 a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or 
backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot
 without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball 
with both hands then resume dribbling.<br>

The five players on each side fall into five playing positions.
 The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest 
and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more
agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or
 the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point 
guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the 
execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning).
 Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and 
one-on-one.
